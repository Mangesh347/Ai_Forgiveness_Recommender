Steps to Run Flask Backend and Flutter Frontend
1. Run Flask Backend (Python Server)
Step 1: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where main.py (your Flask app) is located.

Step 2: Start the Flask server using the command:

python main.py
Step 3: Flask will start running and be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or your local IP like http://192.168.x.x:5000).

2. Run Flutter Web App (Frontend)
Step 1: Open a second terminal and navigate to your Flutter project directory.

Step 2: Run the following command to start the Flutter app in your browser:

flutter run -d chrome
Step 3: The Flutter app will launch in Chrome, and it will try to connect to the Flask backend at http://127.0.0.1:5000/get_advice (or your local IP address).

Key Changes to Make Sure Everything Works
API URL in Flutter:

Use the local IP address (192.168.x.x:5000) instead of localhost or 127.0.0.1 in your Flutter code for GET requests to Flask.

CORS in Flask:

Ensure that CORS is configured to allow requests from the Flutter app:

CORS(app, resources={r"/*": {"origins": "*"}})  # Allow all origins
How It Works:
Flask Backend: The Flask app listens for incoming requests (via GET on /get_advice) and makes an API call to OpenRouter to get advice based on conflict and religion.

Flutter Frontend: The Flutter web app lets the user input a conflict description and religion, then sends a GET request to the Flask backend to get forgiveness advice, which is then displayed in the app.

Recap of Key Commands:
Start Flask:

python main.py
Start Flutter Web:

flutter run -d chrome
